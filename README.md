This repository is a collective of assignments and labs from a dynamic web applications course that I took in Spring 2020. We created data-base driven websites by installing and running web servers, datbase servers, and connectability applications. We learned how to code HTML, CSS Javascript, and also used APIs and MySQL for the final project.
